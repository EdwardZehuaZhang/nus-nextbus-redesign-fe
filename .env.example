# Strongly recommended to proxy Routes/Directions calls via your backend

# NOTE:
# - Do not commit real secrets in .env.* files.
# - Keep only this .env.example in git. Provide real values via CI/CD secrets.
# - For production, set API_URL to your gateway so the mobile app never holds upstream credentials.
